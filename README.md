# JEM207FinalProject
The repository for the final project for the course JEM207 at IES CUNI. The goal of the project is to give "non-technical" user the ability to explore a provided dataset. The input consists of a dataset in one of well-known formats (e.g. `.CSV`, `.JSON`, `.XSLSX`). The output is a summary of the provided data, along with graphical presentations and some selection of fitted models. 

# How to run

There are several ways to run the project. 

## Jupyter

The user can use a Jupyter notebook `run.ipynb`, where they can input a path to the datset, specify target and other variables, and choose from a selection of models. Cells that are not meant to be touched are labeled with the `# SYSTEM CODE` comment.

## Web UI

The user can also use the app by running `run.py`, which will startup a Flask server.
