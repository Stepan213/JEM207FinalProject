# JEM207FinalProject
The repository for the final project for the course JEM207 at IES CUNI.

# Project structure
The main file of the project is `main.ipynb`. Other Python files are meant as support and are used throughout the `main.ipynb` file. 

# Objective of the project
The Boston Housing Dataset used to be popular in CS classes, as it provided simple and reasonable data upon which price prediction algorithms could be trained.

However, it is currently (and rightfully) deemed as controversial. This is mainly due to two issues: 

## 1) Racial bias



## 2) Wealth bias
